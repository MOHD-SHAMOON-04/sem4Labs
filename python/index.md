**Ques4:** A commercial bank has introduced an incentive policy of giving a bonus to all its deposit holders. The policy is as follows:  
> 2% of the balance will be given as a bonus to all, irrespective of their gender or balance.

**Ques5:** The base price of a railway ticket is 200. If a passenger opts for Non-AC sleeper class, then they have to pay a total of (base-price + 2 times the total distance). But if they opt for AC sleeper class, then the total will be (base-price + 3 times the total distance).  
Note: If the passenger is either a student or a senior citizen, then they will receive a 10% discount on the total ticket price.
