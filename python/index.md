**Ques5:** The base price of a railway ticket is 200. If a passenger opts for Non-AC sleeper class, then they have to pay a total of (base price + 2 times the total distance). But if they opt for AC sleeper class, then the total will be (base price + 3 times the total distance).  
Note: If the passenger is either a student or a senior citizen, then they will receive a 10% discount on the total ticket price.
